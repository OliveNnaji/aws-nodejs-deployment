# aws-nodejs-deployment
AWS Node.js Deployment: Deployed a Node.js application on AWS EC2 using PM2 for process management and ensuring zero downtime. Configured security groups, and enhanced scalability and availability. Gained hands-on experience with AWS, Node.js, and DevOps practices in production environments.

The objective was to take an existing Node.js application and make it production-ready using AWS infrastructure and process management tools.

Key highlights include:

- AWS EC2: The Node.js application was deployed on an EC2 instance, allowing it to be scalable and secure.
- PM2: Installed and configured PM2, a process manager for Node.js, to manage the application processes, ensuring that the app runs continuously with automatic restarts in case of failure.
- Security Best Practices: Configured AWS security groups to restrict access to the application and ensure secure communication between the EC2 instance and external sources.
- Zero Downtime Deployment: Ensured the app is always up and running, even during server restarts or maintenance, using PM2â€™s startup script.

This project helped enhance my skills in DevOps, AWS, and Node.js application deployment, providing practical experience in managing applications in a production environment.


PROCESSES

This project demonstrates the deployment of a "Node.js" application on "AWS EC2". It showcases how to configure the application for production, set up process management with "PM2", and ensure high availability and scalability.

Key Features:
- Deployed Node.js app on "AWS EC2"
- Managed application with "PM2"to ensure continuous operation and zero downtime
- Configured "AWS Security Groups" to restrict unauthorized access
- Utilized "PM2 startup script" to ensure the app starts automatically after a reboot

Requirements:
- "AWS Account" (EC2, Security Groups)
- "Node.js" (Installed on your local machine or EC2 instance)
- "PM2" (Process manager for Node.js)

Setup:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. SSH into your EC2 instance and clone the repo there.
3. Run the following commands on the EC2 instance:
   - `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - `pm2 start server.js` to run the application using PM2.
   - `pm2 save` to save the PM2 process list.
   - `pm2 startup` to configure PM2 to restart the app after a reboot.
